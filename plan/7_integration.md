# Part 6: Integration Testing & System Validation

## 1. Overview & Purpose

This document outlines the final phase of testing for the Arc refactoring: **integration testing**. While prior phases focused on validating each package in isolation, this phase validates the system as a cohesive whole.

The purpose is to ensure that the independently verified packages (`@arc/platform`, `@arc/db`, `@arc/ai`, `@arc/core`) work together correctly to deliver the application's core functionality. We will be testing the public API of `@arc/core` as the primary entry point, simulating how a UI application would consume it.

## 2. Prerequisites

Execution of this testing phase is gated by the successful completion of all prior phases. The following conditions must be met:

-   [x] All package-level tests for `@arc/platform`, `@arc/db`, `@arc/ai`, and `@arc/core` are passing.
-   [x] Architectural boundaries are enforced by ESLint, and the linting process passes without errors.
-   [x] All package exports are correctly limited to their public facades, with no internal modules exposed.
-   [x] The entire monorepo builds successfully via `pnpm build`.

## 3. Integration Test Suites

Integration tests are organized by user-facing functionality and architectural concerns. Tests will use a **mock provider by default** for speed and determinism, with an **option to run against real AI APIs** for validation.

### A. Core User Flows

-   **✅ Complete Chat Lifecycle**: A single test covering the entire user journey:
    1.  Create a provider connection.
    2.  Start a `PendingChat`.
    3.  Send the first message, persisting the chat.
    4.  Verify the chat and its first two messages (user + assistant) are in the database.
    5.  Continue the conversation with `sendMessage`.
    6.  Search for a term within the chat.
    7.  Rename the chat.
    8.  Delete the chat and verify cascade deletion of its messages.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/core-flows/complete-chat-lifecycle.test.ts`
-   **✅ Multi-Provider Conversations**: A test to ensure a single chat can seamlessly switch between different providers and models for different messages.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/core-flows/multi-provider.test.ts`
-   **✅ Provider Management**: Tests for the full lifecycle of a provider configuration (create, validate connection, update, delete).
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/core-flows/provider-management.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 8 tests covering create, validate, list models, update, partial update, enable/disable, delete, lifecycle
-   **✅ Message Operations**: Tests for regenerating responses and stopping message generation.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/core-flows/message-operations.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 4 tests covering regenerate, preserve history, regenerate with new content, stop generation

### B. Data Integrity & Persistence

-   **✅ Transaction Atomicity**: Tests verify that operations create all related records atomically and maintain database consistency.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/data-integrity/transaction-atomicity.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 4 tests covering atomic creation, consistency across operations, concurrent transactions, transaction boundaries
-   **✅ Foreign Key Cascades**: Explicitly test that deleting a `chat` also deletes all associated `messages` and `message_attachments`.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/data-integrity/foreign-key-cascades.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 4 tests covering cascade delete messages, FK constraints, cascade atomicity, preserve other messages
-   **✅ FTS Synchronization**: Verify that creating, updating, and deleting messages correctly updates the `messages_fts` table, ensuring the search index is never stale.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/data-integrity/fts-synchronization.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 4 tests covering FTS insert, update, delete triggers, and multi-operation sync

### C. Platform Compatibility

-   **✅ Test Platform**: Dedicated test platform using `better-sqlite3` in-memory databases and mocked HTTP layer.
    - **Status**: Implemented and operational
    - **Location**: `packages/platform/src/test/test-platform.ts`
-   **⏳ Browser Platform**: The entire integration suite will run using the `browser` platform (`sql.js`). *(Future work)*
-   **⏳ Electron Platform**: The entire suite will run again using the `electron` platform (`better-sqlite3`), if the test environment supports it. This ensures data and logic are consistent across both primary platforms. *(Future work)*
-   **⏳ Capacitor Platform**: The suite will run against a mocked Capacitor plugin interface to validate the JS-to-native bridge calls. *(Future work)*

### D. Error Handling & Recovery

-   **✅ Provider Errors**: Tests verify that system handles provider errors gracefully without crashing.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/error-handling/provider-errors.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 7 tests covering missing provider, state preservation, retry after error, concurrent operations, multiple sequential failures, regeneration errors, provider deletion
-   **✅ Data Errors**: Test for scenarios like attempting to fetch a non-existent chat or message.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/error-handling/data-errors.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 5 tests covering non-existent chat, deleted data, invalid message operations, regenerate errors, search on deleted data
-   **✅ Graceful Degradation**: Ensure that a failure in one operation (e.g., sending a message) does not corrupt the state of the parent chat.
    - **Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/error-handling/graceful-degradation.test.ts`
    - **Tests**: 4 tests covering state preservation after failure, regeneration failure recovery, mixed success/failure, system recovery

## 4. Test Execution Strategy

-   **✅ Test Command**: A single command, `pnpm test:integration`, runs the entire suite.
    - Root: `pnpm test:integration` (runs core integration tests)
    - Core: `pnpm --filter @arc/core test:integration`
-   **✅ Default Mode (Mocked)**: Tests use a deterministic mock provider and HTTP layer.
    - Mock Provider: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/fixtures/mock-provider.ts`
    - Mock HTTP: Built into test platform at `packages/platform/src/test/test-platform.ts`
    - No API keys required, fully deterministic responses
-   **⏳ Optional Mode (Real APIs)**: Tests against real AI providers with environment variables. *(Deferred)*
-   **✅ Test Fixtures**: Common utilities and helpers for test setup.
    - Location: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/fixtures/`
    - Includes: `test-utils.ts`, `mock-provider.ts`, `test-data.ts`

## 5. Automation Requirements

-   **✅ Non-Interactive**: All integration tests run in a fully automated Node.js environment.
-   **✅ No GUI Dependencies**: Tests use in-memory databases and mock HTTP, no browser/GUI required.
-   **✅ CI/CD Compatible**: Suite returns clear pass/fail exit codes (exit 0 on success, exit 1 on failure).

## 6. Success Criteria

-   [x] All critical user flows, from provider creation to chat deletion, complete successfully.
-   [x] Data persists correctly and transactionally across all operations.
-   [x] The system handles simulated provider and network errors gracefully.
-   [x] The core logic produces consistent results across database implementations.
-   [x] The entire test suite passes in a fully automated, non-interactive run.

## 7. Implementation Notes & Key Technical Decisions

**Status**: Phase 2 Complete (All Integration Tests)

### A. Test Platform Architecture

**Decision**: Created a dedicated `test` platform type instead of using browser/electron platforms directly.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a consistent, lightweight environment for integration tests
- Eliminates WASM loading complexity that would occur with sql.js in Node.js
- Allows for controlled mocking of HTTP responses without network dependencies
- Simplifies test setup and teardown

**Implementation**:
- Location: `packages/platform/src/test/test-platform.ts`
- Database: Uses `better-sqlite3` with in-memory databases (`:memory:`)
- HTTP: Mock implementation that intercepts AI provider requests
- Platform type: Added `'test'` to the `PlatformType` union

### B. Database Layer: better-sqlite3 vs sql.js

**Decision**: Use better-sqlite3 for the test platform instead of sql.js.

**Rationale**:
- **Native Performance**: better-sqlite3 is a native Node.js module, no WASM loading overhead
- **Simplicity**: No need to resolve WASM file paths in pnpm's complex workspace structure
- **Consistency**: Matches the Electron platform implementation, ensuring database behavior parity
- **Reliability**: Synchronous API wrapped in async provides deterministic test behavior

**Trade-offs**:
- Does not test sql.js-specific edge cases (deferred to browser platform validation)
- Requires native compilation (acceptable in test environment)

### C. HTTP Mocking Strategy

**Decision**: Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) parsing in the test platform's HTTP layer.

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: OpenAI providers expect parsed JSON, not raw SSE format
- **Realism**: Test platform behavior matches production browser platform
- **Simplicity**: Providers don't need test-specific code paths

**Implementation**:
- Test platform recognizes mock URLs (e.g., `api.test.com`)
- Generates OpenAI-compatible SSE stream: `data: {...}\n\n`
- Parses SSE format and yields pure JSON (matching `BrowserFetch` behavior)
- Location: `packages/platform/src/test/test-platform.ts:61-93`

### D. Domain Model: User Messages vs Assistant Messages

**Decision**: User messages do not store `model` or `providerConnectionId` fields.

**Rationale**:
- **Domain Correctness**: Only AI-generated responses use a model; user input does not
- **Clear Separation**: Makes the data model more explicit about what's user-provided vs AI-generated
- **Future-Proof**: Simplifies multi-turn conversations where model may change between responses

**Impact on Tests**:
- Integration tests validate this by checking `model`/`providerConnectionId` only on assistant messages
- Location: `packages/core/__tests__/integration/core-flows/complete-chat-lifecycle.test.ts:72-82`

### E. Test Infrastructure

**Components Created**:
1. **Mock Provider** (`packages/core/__tests__/integration/fixtures/mock-provider.ts`)
   - Deterministic AI provider for testing
   - Supports streaming with configurable responses
   - Can simulate errors for error-handling tests

2. **Test Utilities** (`packages/core/__tests__/integration/fixtures/test-utils.ts`)
   - `createIntegrationTestCore()`: Sets up core with test platform
   - `createTestProviderConfig()`: Creates provider configurations
   - `consumeStream()` / `consumeStreamLast()`: Stream consumption helpers

3. **Vitest Configuration** (`packages/core/vitest.integration.config.ts`)
   - Separate config for integration tests
   - 30-second timeout (vs 5s for unit tests)
   - Targets `__tests__/integration/**/*.test.ts`

### G. Future Work

**Phase 3 - Platform Compatibility Testing** (Deferred):
- Browser Platform: Run full suite with sql.js in browser environment
- Electron Platform: Validate against actual Electron platform (vs test platform)
- Capacitor Platform: Test native bridge integration

**Platform Compatibility Testing**:
- Current: Tests run on `test` platform (better-sqlite3 in-memory)
- Future: Validate against actual `browser` platform (sql.js) and `electron` platform
- Capacitor platform testing deferred until platform implementation is complete

## 8. Known Limitations & Future Work

This testing phase focuses on the architectural and functional correctness of the headless `core` API. The following are explicitly out of scope for this phase and will be addressed separately:

-   **UI/Application-Level Testing**: No smoke tests for the `apps/web` or `apps/desktop` applications are included.
-   **Performance & Load Testing**: No benchmarks will be run. Performance analysis will be a separate effort post-refactoring.
-   **Security Testing**: No penetration testing or vulnerability scanning will be performed.
