# Code of Conduct

## Code Style Hierarchy

**Mandatory code style priority (in order):**

1. **Elegant** - Code should be beautiful and well-composed
2. **Simple** - Code should be straightforward and easy to understand
3. **Clean and clear** - Code should be readable and maintainable
4. **Concise** - Code should be brief without sacrificing clarity
5. **Short** - Code should be compact when all above criteria are met

## Design Principles

- Always default to **elegant, minimal technical design**
- Prioritize beauty and composition in code architecture
- Simplicity takes precedence over cleverness
- Clarity is more important than brevity
- When in doubt, choose the more elegant solution

## Comment Style

- **Don't comment everything** - Only add comments where necessary
- **Focus on why, not what** - Explain rationales and reasoning, not obvious code behavior
- **Write for future AI agents** - Comments should inform consistent thinking and decision-making
- **Document architectural decisions** - Explain why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- Comments are for context that isn't obvious from reading the code itself
