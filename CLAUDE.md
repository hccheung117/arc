# Engineering Standards & Guidelines

## Philosophy

- **No Backward Compatibility**: **NEVER** consider backward compatibility or compromise for legacy concerns.
- **No Future Code**: Everything in the codebase must be in active use.
- **Zero Tech Debt**: Eliminate tech debt **immediately** upon discovery.
- **Derivation**: **Always derive** state, unless the cost is prohibitive.

## Conduct

- **Proactive Documentation**: Must use context7 to retrieve the latest documentation before implementation.
- **Package Management**: Use **npm** only.
- **Commenting**: Comment **only** on decisions and trade-offs. Be concise and avoid describing obvious logic.
