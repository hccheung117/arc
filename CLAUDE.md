# Code of Conduct

## Code Style Hierarchy

**Mandatory code style priority (in order):**

1. **Elegant** - Code should be beautiful and well-composed
2. **Simple** - Code should be straightforward and easy to understand
3. **Clean and clear** - Code should be readable and maintainable
4. **Concise** - Code should be brief without sacrificing clarity
5. **Short** - Code should be compact when all above criteria are met

## Design Principles

- Always default to **elegant, minimal technical design**
- Prioritize beauty and composition in code architecture
- Simplicity takes precedence over cleverness
- Clarity is more important than brevity
- When in doubt, choose the more elegant solution
- **Single source of truth** - Enforce single source of truth anytime anywhere to prevent duplication and maintain consistency

## Comment Style

- **Code should be self-documenting** - Write code that explains itself through clear naming and structure
- **Comments are for specific purposes only:**
  - Explain **why**, never **what** - Rationales and reasoning, not code behavior
  - Document **architectural decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
  - Provide **context for future AI agents** - Inform consistent thinking and decision-making
- **Avoid code-explaining comments** - They are redundant when code is properly written
- **Do not add comments beyond the stated purposes** - If the code needs explanation, refactor it to be clearer
